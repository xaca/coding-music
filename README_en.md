# C:heart_eyes:ding Music

We seek to create lists in text with the names of songs organized by genre. This is an initiative for when you need musical inspiration when programming.

## Instructions

1. The songs must be organized by genre. In order to do this, you must look for the folder according to the genre.
2. If the song you want to share is not in any of the existing genres, you can create it after asking to make sure the new genre is valid.
3. Inside each folder there is a file (in markdown format) with the name of the genre. This must be edited, taking into account not to repeat any songs and to add it to the inal of the file, according to the order that carries the list.
4. You must write the name of the song + artist, and also make sure to put a YouTube link.
5. There are very similar genres, so please be careful regarding the classification of the song.
6. You must participate with a minimum of 5 songs for the contribution to be valid.

## About The Project

This project was born in Hacktoberfest to promote participation in a collaborative project with the idea of creating playlists on YouTube to lead to programming with more flavor, more energy, more swing or better said, to the sound that I program.
